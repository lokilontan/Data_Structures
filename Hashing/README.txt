10-elements array - I`ll use 11, cause lecture says prime number must be used; 
Add items using next order of hashing mechanisms and if collide move forward; 
Modulo-division->Double hashing->3xQuadratic probing->Linear probing; 
Ask the user for the number to find. If not found, display: "Not in the list!"; 0 in the array is a NULL (not an element)
